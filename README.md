# 🌱 Evolve Bootcamp – Physical Computing for Climate Action
Welcome to the official code repository for the Evolve Bootcamp, a curriculum designed for learners aged 10–15 years (KS2) with no prior programming experience. This program introduces young learners to physical computing and coding by engaging them in real-world projects focused on climate change and environmental sustainability.

# 🔍 Overview
This repository contains codes used during the Evolve Bootcamp. 
Through hands-on activities and guided tutorials on Google Classroom, learners explore how to prototype technology-based solutions to climate-caused natural hazards using tools such as micro:bit and sensors.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand the impact of climate-induced natural hazards (e.g. floods, heatwaves, droughts).

Design and build early warning systems such heatwave EWS, Drought EWS using physical computing.

Learn to harness renewable energy sources like solar and wind power as alternative power sources.

Gain beginner-friendly skills in computer programming(Python and Codeblocks) and Basic electronics.

Develop problem-solving and design thinking through real-world challenges.
