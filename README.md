# üå± Evolve Bootcamp ‚Äì Physical Computing for Climate Action
Welcome to the official code repository for the Evolve Bootcamp, a curriculum designed for learners aged 10‚Äì15 years (KS2) with no prior programming experience. This program introduces young learners to physical computing and coding by engaging them in real-world projects focused on climate change and environmental sustainability.

# üîç Overview
This repository showcases codes k-12 learners aged 7‚Äì15 used in the Climate Change module in the After-School Program. Using the BBC micro:bit (programmed with Microsoft MakeCode) and Raspberry Pi Pico W (using Thonny IDE with MicroPython), learners built practical solutions to local climate challenges such as heatwave alerts, drought early warning systems, and renewable energy scouts.
Informed by Constructionism (Papert, 1980), the program integrated Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (Ladson-Billings, 1995), Universal Design for Learning (CAST, 2018), and Social Constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978) to support inclusive, hands-on STEAM learning. 


# üéØ Learning Objectives
Understand the impact of climate-induced natural hazards (e.g. floods, heatwaves, droughts).

Design and build early warning systems such heatwave EWS, Drought EWS using physical computing.

Learn to harness renewable energy sources like solar and wind power as alternative power sources.

Gain beginner-friendly skills in computer programming(Python and Codeblocks) and Basic electronics.

Develop problem-solving and design thinking through real-world challenges.
